* Has a New Grid button which adds the number of grids based on the user input.
* Etch a Sketch contains Flexbox for the styling.

## How to use

* To start using, hover the mouse over the already made grid structure.
* Click the Reset button to clear the grid interface.
* Select the New Grid button if you wish to add a custom grid interface.
* Enter the value in the New Grid button to create a custom grid.

## Possible future additions

None that I can find. Project is completed as it is.

### UI / UX
* It only involves hovering the mouse over the grid interface and the DOM changing the etch a sketch's grid colors depending on the mouse's location.
* Displaying of the result is shown in the etch a sketch's grids.
* Flexbox is heavily used for the layout of the Etch a Sketch.
